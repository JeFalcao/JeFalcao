## Hi there 👋

**JeFalcao/JeFalcao** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- I am a biologist who focused on different areas of interest during my formation, but I was always fascinated by insects and their interactions with plants. This broad interest has led me to study biological control, then ant-plant interactions, and in my phD, I initially focused on pollination by bees, which led me to study the effect of exotic and invasive plants on this interaction. And that was when I finally found the subject I am really invested and passionate about: the puzzling mechanisms of invasibility and invasiveness by plants. Currently I am interested in studying the phylogenetic structure of exotic and native plant  assemblages in the Mexican montane cloud forest, in the hope to solve a few of the many pieces of this puzzle.
